1. Fetch the instruction
The CPU presents, on the address bus, the value stored in the Program
Counter. This is the memory address of the next instruction that is to be
executed. The CPU then fetches the instruction from main memory via
the data bus, and it is then placed into the CIR. The Program Counter is
incremented to contain the address the next instruction.

2. Execute the instruction
The CU passes the decoded information as a sequence of control signals
to the relevant function units of the CPU to perform the actions required
by the instruction such as reading values from registers, passing them to
the ALU to perform mathematical or logic functions on them, and writing
the result back to a register. If the ALU is involved, it sends a condition
signal back to the CU.

3. Store results
The result generated by the operation is stored in the main memory, or
sent to an output device. Based on the condition of any feedback from
the ALU, Program Counter may be updated to a different address from
which the next instruction will be fetched.
